Q: What is a good workshop to start with?
A: If you have 15 minutes, I recommend starting with 'Autonomous Database 15 Minute Quick Start'. In it, you learn how to provision your first ADB instance, load data, and fire your first SQL commands. Another good one is 'Get Started with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core Services'. The best workshop to learn the basics about OCI. Here are the URL: Get Started with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core Services-https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=133:180:4845895269619::::wid:648 and Autonomous Database 15 Minute Quick Start - https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=928

Q: I am not able to create a database password.
A: Make sure the password you enter satisfies the following restrictions

====

Q: I am not able to connect to a noVNC server
A: Are you connected to a VPN or corporate network or behind a strict firewall? If any of these three conditions are true, some ports in your network may be closed to traffic. Uploading data through Database Actions in your web browser and applications like the Oracle Analytics Tool could be restricted and may appear to "Hang" or freeze. Please disconnect from your VPN and try again if applicable. If you are connected to a corporate network, try switching to a public or a "clear" network if allowed. Alternatively, contact your IT Administrator to see if adding exceptions to your network or firewall would be viable.
